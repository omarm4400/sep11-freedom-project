The first blog entry is always the hardest for a lot of reason. First because it is the most difficult and second because it sets you up for the next entries. The most diffecult challenge I faced and it's propply the most diffecult for a lot of people too, was choosing the right tool. Since you have so many options with different difculties it's very hard to find the one that matches your idea. I know that because before I choose the tool that I have now which is impact, I have chosen kaboom because my idea was to creat a shooting game, but once I digged into it I found out that it's very hard to creat a shooting game using kaboom because kaboom is mostly for games like pacman, it doesn't deal with shooting or these typs of action. Impact on the other hand allawys you to do all of that with better quality.
In order for me to choose the right tool I had to tinker first so I  have watched some videos on youtube and went to the impact website and created a small game.

This game is like Retro Ping Pong game, you play against the computer, then you move your baddle and you hit the ball so it goes into the computer's net. I first had to download the images to creat the layers and the ball and the baddles and I had to asign each of them a jop as you can see here

Here I have used if else statments to help me asign the images that I downloaded a jop and also adjust the size and the place for each one of them. For me blog one is the most important one because once you know what to do in blog one, in the next blogs you just need to make small changes.

# Engineering Design Process:
I am now on the first step of EDP (Engineering Design Process), which is defining the problem, My proplem now is to find a easyer way to edit in impact after I write my code. The editor in my impact doesn't work because of my prowser and that can prevernt me from adding a lot of things to my code. so in the next step I need to research the problem and try to find a solution to it.

# Skills:
## How to choose proprly :
This whole entry is about choosing so of course you have to choose the right way. I grew this skill by trying stuff and looking at people's reviews, so I can see if my choice will be the right one or not. 
## How to tinker :
If I didn't tinker then the first skill that I wrote is usless because this is the main way to find if what you're choosing is matching your ideas or not so i=in my opinion this is the most important skill you can have in this entry or in your life overall.
