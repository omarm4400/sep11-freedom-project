The first blog entry is always the hardest for a lot of reasons. First because it is the most difficult, and second because it sets you up for the next entries. The most difficult challenge I faced, and it's probably the most difficult for a lot of people too, was choosing the right tool. Since you have so many options with different difficulties, it's very hard to find the one that matches your idea. I know that because before I chose the tool that I have now, which is impact, I have chosen Kaboom because my idea was to create a shooting game, but once I dug into it, I found out that it's very hard to create a shooting game using kaboom because kaboom is mostly for games like Pacman; it doesn't deal with shooting or these types of action. Impact, on the other hand, allawys you to do all of that with better quality.
In order for me to choose the right tool, I had to tinker first, so I watched some videos on YouTube and went to the Impact website and created a small game.

This game is like a retro ping pong game; you play against the computer, then you move your paddle and you hit the ball so it goes into the computer's net. I first had to download the images to create the layers, the ball, and the paddles, and I had to assign each of them a job, as you can see here.

Here I have used if else statments to help me assign the images that I downloaded a jop and also adjust the size and the place for each one of them. For me, blog one is the most important one because once you know what to do in blog one, in the next blogs you just need to make small changes.

# Engineering Design Process:
I am now on the first step of EDP (Engineering Design Process), which is defining the problem. My goal now is to find an easier way to edit in Impact after I write my code. The editor in my impact doesn't work because of my project, and that can prevent me from adding a lot of things to my code. So in the next step I need to research the problem and try to find a solution to it.

# Skills:
## How to choose properly:
This whole entry is about choosing, so of course you have to choose the right way. I grew this skill by trying stuff and looking at people's reviews, so I can see if my choice will be the right one or not. 
## How to Tinker:
If I didn't tinker, then the first skill that I wrote is useless because this is the main way to find if what you're choosing is matching your ideas or not, so, in my opinion, this is the most important skill you can have in this entry or in your life overall.
