I have faced a lot of diffculties between Entry 1 and Entry 2 because of my tool. The weltmeister is the main editor in my tool impact and with out it, impact wouldn't work so I had difficulties getting it to work on my IDE., I tried everything so I can get it to work like asking on slack and searching it up, I also added impact to reblit so maybe it could work there, but it didn't. But finally after many tries my teacher gave me the right code to make it work, which was adding this code on my ide:```php -S localhost:8000```. After that I started to tinker with weltmeister and I started to do different things by downloading some imges so I can turn them into entities and tinker with them on weltmeister.[this video](https://impactjs.com/documentation/video-tutorial-weltmeister) helped me a lot with weltmeister because I didn't know first how it works.
