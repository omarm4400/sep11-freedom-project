I have faced a lot of difficulties between Entry 1 and Entry 2 because of my tool. The weltmeister is the main editor in my tool, Impact, and without it, Impact wouldn't work, so I had difficulties getting it to work on my IDE. I tried everything so I could get it to work, like asking on Slack and searching it up. I also added Impact to Replit, so maybe it could work there, but it didn't. But finally, after many tries, my teacher gave me the right code to make it work, which was adding this code on my IDE: ```php -S localhost:8000```. After that I started to tinker with Weltmeister, and I started to do different things by downloading some images so I could turn them into entities and tinker with them on Weltmeister. [this video](https://impactjs.com/documentation/video-tutorial-weltmeister) helped me a lot with weltmeister because I didn't know first how it works. After I watched the video, I tinkered with Weltmeister, and I tried to create a small map using the entities that I created.

# Engineering Design Process:
I am now in the second step of the EDP, which is searching the problem. After I got Weltmeister to work, when I try to add the entire folder, Weltmeister stops working, so I need to find out how to add the entities folder without crashing out Weltmeister. Out of all the videos that I watched, all of them had the entities folder downloaded without them having to add it, but when I cloned Impact from GitHub, I didn't have it. So I need to work on fixing that. 
# Skills:
1) The first skill that I grew is asking people for help, because I've faced a lot of difficulties when I was trying to figure out how to get Welmeister to work, so I had to ask questions on Slack, and I had to ask my teacher. And I feel that sometimes people might feel shy doing that, but it's really worth it to ask instead of just not doing anything about it.
2) My second skill is to use the right resources, because when I was trying to learn impact, there were a lot of unreliable resources, and for me, the right way is to use the main website for whatever you are learning. Or maybe you have to do the right research for what you're looking for because when I was trying to learn impact, I had to search up a lot of different things to get the source that I needed to learn impact. So I think this is a very important skill to have. 
# My goal for the break:
On the break I want to fix all the issues that I have in impact, like the entities folder that crashes out of Weltmeister, and I want to have the ability to control the entities that I created in Weltmeister. And that will help create more characters and control them so I can create a small game. I'm planning on doing that by asking more questions and doing more research.
