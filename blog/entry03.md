Over the break I have learned a lot of things about impact.js, and I have used what I learned to create some stuff. I learned a lot about weltmeister and using the keybottons and used a ll of that to create a small game. Even though this game is not fully functioning yet but after I created it I felt like I 've learned a lot about imapact.js
