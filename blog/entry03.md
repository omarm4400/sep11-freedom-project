Over the break I have learned a lot of things about impact.js, and I have used what I learned to create some stuff. I learned a lot about Weltmeister and using the key buttons and used all of that to create a small game. Even though this game is not fully functioning yet, after I created it, I felt like I ''d learned a lot about impact.js.![Screenshot 2025-02-09 8 36 17 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2153d8aa-5ae4-4891-84f2-42569c41d83f)

This is the small game that I've created over the break using Weltmeister and some code that I learned, like the key buttons.

I've watched this [video](https://youtu.be/hMXWImAuim8?si=jtOgFdneWkkkqDhk) multiple times, and every time I watch it, I learn something new. Because not only does this video teach me about the basics of Impact, it also teaches me a lot of things on how to use Welmeister, which was very useful because it is a very hard editor, and it takes a lot of time to learn.

# Engineering Design Process:

I am now still in the second step of the EDP, which is searching the problem. Because after the issue that happened with me last time with Weltmeister, now I need to know how to fix the game page itself. Because now, after I finished the game and everything in Weltmeister and in my IDE, it's showing me an empty page when I try to load the game.

# Skills:

The skills that I continued to grow were how to take information the right way and get the full benefit of it. Since Impact.js doesn't provide that many tools to use, so I can learn more about Impact, I have to try to use every piece of information that is available to me and try to make use of them. I did that by taking notes and focusing a lot on the things that I watched.

Another skill that I continued to grow was asking people for help. Since not a lot of people in my class have learned Impact.js, I needed to try to find a way to ask questions, and I did that by using slack.com and talking to my teacher about questions that I have. On Slack, there are people who have learned from the past, and they can benefit me a lot by teaching me some of the things that they learned or helping me if I have any questions.

# My goal:

As I said before, my goal now is to try to find a way to make the game work, because right now whenever I try to load the gameme, all that opens up is a empty screen. I am planing on doing that by asking more questions on slak or by seariching the issue up.
