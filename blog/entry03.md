Over the break I have learned a lot of things about impact.js, and I have used what I learned to create some stuff. I learned a lot about weltmeister and using the keybottons and used a ll of that to create a small game. Even though this game is not fully functioning yet but after I created it I felt like I 've learned a lot about imapact.js

I've watched this [video](https://youtu.be/hMXWImAuim8?si=jtOgFdneWkkkqDhk) multiple times and everytime I watch it I learn something new. Because not only does this video teach me about the basics of inpact, it also teaches me a lot of things on how to use weltmeister which was very usefull because it is veryhard editor and it takes a lot of time to learn.
# Engineering Design Process:
I am now still in the second step of the EDP, which is searching the problem. Because after the issue that happend with me last time with weltmeister, now I need to know how to fix the game page it slef. because now after I finished the game and everthing in weltmeister and in my IDE its showing me an empty page when I try to load the game.
# Skills:
The skills that I continued on growing was how to take information the right way and get the full benifet of it. since impact.js doesn't provide that much tools to use so I can learn more about impact I have to try to use every piece of information that is avalable to me and try to make use of them. I did that by taking notes and focusing a lot on the things that I watched.
Another skill that I continued on growing was asking people for help. since not a lot of people in my class have learned Impact.js I needed to try to find a way to ask questions and I did that by usign slack.com and talking to my teacher about questions that I have. on slack there are people who have learned impact form before and they can benifit me a lot by teaching me some of the things that they learned or to help me if I have any questions.
# My goal:
As I said before my goal now is to try to find a way to make the game work, becasue right now when I ever try to load the game, all that opens up is a empty screen. I am planing on doing that by asking more questions on slak or by seariching the issue up.
