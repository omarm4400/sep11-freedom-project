Since this month my freedom project partner left, I had to switch. My tool, and it was a very hard thing to do because it is the middle of the year, and I had to learn a new tool in a short time, and also I couldn't finish all the project by myself because it's hard to be done by one person. So this month I was focused on learning a new tool, which was Kaboom. Since I just started learning it not too long ago, I couldn't do that much in it. I've used this [website]([https://youtu.be/hMXWImAuim8?si=jtOgFdneWkkkqDhk](https://kaboomjs.com/) which helped me a lot learning kaboom. I've also used the projects they added and tried to tinker with it, because it's very helpful when trying to learn a new tool.

# Engineering Design Process:

I think I am now in the second step of the EDP, which is searching for the problem. Because I need to find a quick way to learn Kaboom because of the short amount of time that I have right now. And I think to do that I will need to tinker more and watch more videos on YouTube. 

# Skills:

I think the skills I used are very obvious because all I did was tinker in this past month and also ask people for the right tool to use. The only way to learn something quickly is to tinker with it, and so I had to do that using the playground in the kaboom.js website, which I used to edit some of the code they had there to see the jobs of every element.

Asking people for help was also a very helpful skill because I didn't know what tool I had to use after impact, and I didn't want to repeat the same mistake of choosing a tool that doesn't have any helpful resources to look at for help. So I think these two skills were very valuable for this entry.
