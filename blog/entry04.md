Since this mounth my freedom project partner left sep I had to switch My tool and it was a very hard thing to do because it is the middle of t5he year and I had to learn a new tool in a short time and also I couldn't finish all the project by my self because it's hard to be done by one person.So this mounth I was focused on learning a new tool wich was kaboom. Since I just start learing it, not to long ago I couldn't do that much in it. I've used this [website]([https://youtu.be/hMXWImAuim8?si=jtOgFdneWkkkqDhk](https://kaboomjs.com/) which helped me a lot learning kaboom. I've also used the projects they added and tried to tinker with it, because it's very helpfull when trying to learn a new tool.

# Engineering Design Process:
I think I am now in the second step of the EDP, which is searching the problem. Because I need to find a quick way to learn kaboom, because of the short amount of time that I have right now. And I think to do that I will need to tinker more and watch more videos on youtube. 
# Skills:
I think the skills I used are very ovious because all I did was tinker in this past mounth and also asking people for the right tool to use. The only way to learn something in a quick way is to tinker with it and so I had to do that using the playground in the kaboom.js website which I used to edit some of the code tehy had there to see the jobs of every element.
Asking people for help was also a very helpfull skill because I didn't know what tool I had to use after impact and I didn't want to repeat the same mistake of choosing a tool that doesn't have any helpfull resources to look at for help. So I think these two skills were very valuable this entry.
