# Entry 5

After my last entry, I tried all my hardest to learn kaboom.js in a short amount of time, so I could finish with my MVP. I didn't use a lot of different resources to learn. I only watched some [videos](https://youtu.be/hMXWImAuim8?si=jtOgFdneWkkkqDhk) on YouTube, asked some friends and, of course, used the kaboom website. While learning [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) I have noticed that it is so similar to what I am learning right now in my Sep class because it is mostly JavaScript. My game was about a character that shoots bullets against enemies, and it counts how many enemies you killed and how many enemies are spawned. Which was all done by the use of if else, statements, functions and loops.



This is a preview of my MVP.

# Engineering Design Process:
I think right now I am in the 7th step of the EDP because I have already created everything, but I just need improvement. In my freedom project I would add some things like a button that restarts the game because you need to refresh every time you lose.



# Skills:

I think there are only two skills needed during this entry.

The first one is improving communication. For me, communication was all that was there for me to do in order for me to finish up my MVP. I did that by trying not to be shy when I ask people for help when I need it. The second skill was just trying different ways to learn things. Like, for example, if I didn't try every resource possible to learn kaboom, I would've never learned it or finish my MVP, so I really had to search for different sources and ask a lot of people to learn kaboom in the fastes way possible.
