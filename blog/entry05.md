After my last entry I have tryied all my hard to learn kaboom.js in a short amount of time so i can finish with my MVP. I didn't use a lot of different resources to lear i only watched some [videos](https://youtu.be/hMXWImAuim8?si=jtOgFdneWkkkqDhk) on youtube asked some friends and of course ued the kaboom website. while learning [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) I have noticed that it is so similar to what I am learning right now in my Sep class because it is mostly Java scribt. My game was about a charecter that shoots bullets against enimes and it counts how many enimes you killed and how many enimes are spawn. Which was all donr by the use of if else statments, functions and loops.

This is a preview of my MVP

# Engineering Design Process:
I think right now I am in the 7th step of the EDP because I have already created evry thing, But i just need improvment. In my freedome project I would add some things like a botton that restarts the game because you need to refresh everytime you lose.

# Skills:
I think there been only two skills needed during this Entry.
The first one is improving comunication. For me commnication was all that was there for me to do in order for me to finsh up my MVP. I did that by tring not to be shy when I ask people for help when I need it. The second skill was just trying different ways to learn things, like for example if i didn't try every source possible to learn kaboom, I would've never learned it or finish my MVP so i realy had to search for different sources and ask a lot of people to learn kaboom in the fastes way possible.
