After my last entry I have tryied all my hard to learn kaboom.js in a short amount of time so i can finish with my MVP. I didn't use a lot of different resources to lear i only watched some [videos](https://youtu.be/hMXWImAuim8?si=jtOgFdneWkkkqDhk) on youtube asked some friends and of course ued the kaboom website. while learning [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) I have noticed that it is so similar to what I am learning right now in my Sep class because it is mostly Java scribt. My game was about a charecter that shoots bullets against enimes and it counts how many enimes you killed and how many enimes are spawn.
