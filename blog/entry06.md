# Content:
During my Expo elevator pitch and class presentation of my Freedom Project, I had many takeaways, and I believe they are very important.
My first takeaway was the importance of practice. Both the Expo elevator pitch and the class presentation required a lot of preparation, and I experimented with different ways to practice. For example, I presented in front of my family and asked for their feedback. I also did the same with my friends to hear their thoughts. Another approach I tried was recording myself while presenting and then watching the recording. Through this, I noticed that I said "ummmm" many times. I worked on reducing that habit, but when I presented in front of the class, I still found myself saying it because I forgot everything I had practiced once I was called to present. However, during the Expo elevator pitch, I managed to avoid saying it entirely.

My second takeaway was the value of asking for help. This was especially important because, without feedback from my friends and family, I wouldn't have been able to identify the issues in my presentation. Their insights allowed me to recognize areas that needed improvement.

One challenge I faced was with the presentation of [my slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xiSwWBfyl63gXgvFHaFQy74HBGitcikITocqaJOdQag/edit?usp=sharing). I focused heavily on the actual content like my challenges, takeaways, and the overall presentation of my project but I neglected the introduction, including my hook.

# Engineering Design Process
I am now in the final step of my Engineering Design Process: communicating the results. I have completed my presentation, including the improvements I wanted to implement from last time (beyond MVP). I presented my project to my classmates and received their feedback. I plan to use this feedback to improve my work next year.

# Skills
The skills I developed align closely with my takeaways. For instance, I improved my communication skills, which helped me both in delivering my presentation and in understanding my classmatesâ€™ perspectives on my project. Another skill I strengthened was practicing and learning from my mistakes. By recording and reviewing my presentation, I was able to identify areas for improvement and work toward a more polished delivery.
