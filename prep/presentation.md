# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* I will be talking about other shooting games and compare them to mine, or I will talk about how my game could be different then others.
* I will ask do you know how many shooting game were created and then I will intruduce my game.
* 

## Product
* I will show a prview of my game and talk about how it works and everything you can do in it, like the buttons and the code responsiple for them.

## Process
* I will talk about how I leanred my tool.
* I will talk about the challenges I had when I was learning my tool, Like how I created my enmies and what code I used and how I went beyond mvp
* I will talk about how I created my game and what helped me creating it.

## Conclusion
* I will talk about my takeaways and try summarize my whole project.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
