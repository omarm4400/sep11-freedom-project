### 10/20/24:
I've used this chanel on YouTube( https://youtu.be/Xyl-4FXMXJg?si=EL3BZE-U5Kfg8NOI) to learn anout impact
* Apache:is used to test the games you have created.
* Php: is used to save the levels you've created in the game.
* .defines(function() {
    \\this is where the code goes
});
* impact classes examples:
 var person =ig.class.extend ({
    name: "",
    init:function (name) {
        this.name=name;
    }
})
* toextend classes :
var variable =person.extend({
    init:function(name){
        this.parent( 'variable:' + name)
    }
})
* ig.Animations: takes care of the animation or background
* ig.AnimationSheet:specifis the width and hieght properties for each animation frame
* ig collision takes a 2d map and allows tracing agains it for collisions
* ig.entity is any interactive object that would display on the screan it also help with creating the animations and the drawings.
* ig.font allows us to desplay any text we want or formating font images.
* ig.game is the main hub for the game because it hosts all the background maps and collision maps.
* ig.image allows us to desplay any image or gif we want
* ig.input handels all the keyboard and mous input.
* ig.Loader is responsible for all the images and sounds the game will need
* ig.map is the base class for maps or backgrounds in the game
* ig.music is resposible for background music
* ig.sound file is for the sound files that could be used for the backgorund music
* ig.SoundManger takes care of loading the sound to the game
* ig.system takes care of statrting and stoping the game loop

* This week I continuted to watch this YouTube chanel( https://youtu.be/Xyl-4FXMXJg?si=EL3BZE-U5Kfg8NOI) and I have used it to countine editing a small game that I have made a couble of weeks ago. What I edit was the img of the blocks in my game and I also changed some of the code because there was some erors like when the ball use to hit the wall it use to get stuck there. and right now I am still working on the issue of fixing my editor because it won't work on my ide so I had to use reblit but Icouldn't preview it there so I am tring to ask my friends and people on slack if they can help me with it .

* This weak I finally got my weltmaster to work, so I tinkerd with it by adding some entities and seeing what they do.
I also tried to make some blocks and made them collisions and I tried linking somce entites with collisoins. I watched this video (https://impactjs.com/documentation/video-tutorial-weltmeister) to teach me how to work with weltmaster, and it helped me know what each entity does .

### 12/1/24
* This week I've asked someone on slak to help me with some error that I faced in in impact, which was the entities folder, which I didn't have because when I cloned the impact rebo from githup there was supposed to be an entities folder, but I didn't have and when I asked someone on  (https://slack.com) he told me that I have to add it because its an important file that will help you control the entites you make. so I added it and I've added some entites inside like and added some variables to control the entites like the ig.input which helps you add some keyboard roles to the entitie.
### 12/8/24
This week I continued to work on weltmaster and I have used the entities that I have created to work with it on weltmaster, like the collision entites which I used a lot and I downloaded a photo of a block so I can asign it the collision entite. I felled out weltmaster with blocks so I can see how would they look and what will they do and I also downloaded some images to asign it to the other entites.

3/2/24
This week I started learning a new tool (kaboom), I didn't have enough time this week to explore kaboom, but I asked my friends who have used it on the best way to learn it and they all told me videos and website, so I found a chanel on youtube https://youtu.be/iRXI6ThRJvM?si=BoeCF6dPz19z81p7 and I watched the first steps and I wrote some information on my notes but I didn't have enough time to creat something with it.

3/23.25
This week I continued on learning my new tool and I had the chance to try new things. After I diged a little deep into the kaboom website, and I learned things like how the text is used, rotation and key pressed. I noteced that the materials on kaboom are very simmilar to the ones I am learning in the p5js unit now in class.
This is the code I tried:
